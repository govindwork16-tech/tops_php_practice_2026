what is github  ?
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It is built on top of Git, a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds. GitHub allows developers to host and manage their code repositories, track changes, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects.

Key features of GitHub include:
1. Repositories: GitHub allows users to create repositories (repos) to store their code and related files. Repositories can be public or private.

2. Version Control: GitHub uses Git for version control, enabling developers to track changes to their code over time, revert to previous versions, and manage different branches of development.

3. Collaboration: GitHub provides tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, making it easier for teams to work together on projects.


4. Social Coding: GitHub has a social aspect, allowing users to follow other developers, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects.

5. Integration: GitHub integrates with various third-party tools and services, such as continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, project management tools, and code editors.

Overall, GitHub is a powerful platform that has become a central hub for developers worldwide to share, collaborate, and contribute to software development projects.
